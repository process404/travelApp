## Travel App

An intended evolution of a simple tool created to allow the creation of physical travel planning tables which can be printed off. It is also intended for this project to have a way to log any noteable information about the transport along the journey / journey information (stored locally on the device and exportable to CSV for backup or transfer elsewhere). This app will have PWA support so it can be installed as an 'app' and if possible being able to put locations / logs / journey information notes on a map for interesting viewing.
