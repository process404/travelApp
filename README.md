## Travel App

An intended evolution of a simple tool created to allow the creation of physical travel planning tables which can be printed off. It is also intended for this project to have a way to log any noteable information about the transport along the journey / journey information (stored locally on the device and exportable to CSV for backup or transfer elsewhere). This app will have PWA support so it can be installed as an 'app'. A bonus will be able to show 'useful' and detailed statistics about journeys or trips or logs and use maps to show individual journeys, trips, statistics or all trips at once in a map format. The goal is to make an app which is nice to use aswell as being very useful for trip purposes, with the use of IndexedDB it could be used for longer periods of time as the storage size may be big enough.
