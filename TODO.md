# TO-DO
- Add VIA points for journey (as the app will not be fetching timetable data unless a way is found with minimal / no api usage)
- Start / End Date AND time
- Select / Type Operator using a dropdown list 
    - Bonus (with list of operators to select from across Europe)
- Add fields such as class, ticket costs, delay, train code, leisure / commute, tags (wifi, dining car, sleeper train, cycling)
- Add OSM routing by preloading railway routes and perhaps using station coordinates obtained from list of stations (and the via points) to map out the journey on a map
